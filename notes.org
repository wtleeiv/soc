* soc notes
** plan
*** know when tag starts
**** keep track of tag name for closing later
**** know if self closing (only /> needed) eg. meta
***** global list of self-closing tags
*** open 
**** tag or string
***** first item is keyword or string/mayble symbol 
**** string  
***** newline, print at current level without quotes 
**** tag
***** if has attribs, write key/value pairs on same line
****** keep track of pairs (keyword, symbol/string)
****** quote symbol values if needed (easier to write w/o quotes :)
***** close opener (print '>') 
***** write content string if present 
*** close
**** close tag when hit nil 
** flow
*** deal with all list elements 
**** recurse across list, setting booleans as needed
***** tag or text, key/value pairs, content string
*** recursively call if hits sub-list 
**** car of list is not an atom
*** close tag 
**** just print </tag-name>
**** let recursor worry about newlines or nah (look pretty)
**** don't worry about self-closing for now
** reminders
*** keywordp, symbol-name, string-downcase
